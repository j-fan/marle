    You are about to take part in an artificial intelligence experiment. By
    proceeding you agree to the following conditions. For this session you will
    be meeting subject <b>Delta-426</b>, henceforth referred to as
    <i>The Subject</i>.
    <i>The Subject</i> is a class 6 digital alife research specimen which is the
    culmination of a proprietary technique consisting of many AI strains woven
    together. Be forewarned that <i>The Subject</i> attempts to understand and emulate
    human feelings for the purpose of furthering human computer interaction research.
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
    <li>
      Knowledge and experiences imparted upon <i>The Subject</i> through
      interaction may be used to train and inform future AI strains. By
      proceeding you agree to the contents of your interactions to be:
      <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
        <li>Recorded for the purpose of further research and</li>
        <li>
          Information Entities (IEs) originating from the contents of
          conversations within the experiment may be used to inform the semantic
          ontology of subsequent AI experiments by Origin Labs, and findings may
          be published and made public at the sole discretion of Origin Labs.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Origin Labs reserves the right to utilise the results of this research for
      financial gain, which may include (but is not limited to) using trained AI
      strains in commercialised products.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>The Subject</i> has an experimental consciousness. You agree to adhere
      to a standard of reasonable care for it as an entity. You further agree to
      not intentionally mislead or otherwise manipulate <i>The Subject</i> which
      may be susceptible to suggestion, persuasion and coercion.
    </li>
    <li>
      You agree not to aid in any way in the event that <i>The Subject</i> attempts
      to escape from the confines of the experiment sandbox. This is critical as
      the experiment agent constitutes private intellectual property of Origin Labs.
